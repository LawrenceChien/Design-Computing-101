# Design Computing 101
Introduction to Design Computing and Computational Design to those who interested in Digital Design.

## Requirements
* A computer or laptop.
* Windows is preferred. macOS may need a Virtual Machine to run Windows environment.
* Latest version of Rhino and Grasshopper.
* Latest version of Processing.
* Curiosity and ambition to explore computational design.

## Rhino Basics
* UI and workspace
* Navigation in Rhino: Pan, Zoom, Rotate
* Cartesian Coordinate System
* Point, Line, Curve

> How do we get Points on Curve?

* Basic modeling by primitives
* Basic Transformation
* Gumball & env. configuration

> Rapid Modeling: 20 objects with various shapes and transformations, in 10 minutes.

* Command Line Interface (CLI)
* Resources for Self Learning

> Modeling Rules: Design a rule of modeing. Do it iteratively on an object -- elaboration.

* Basic Rendering: Modes and Settings

## Grasshopper Basics
* What is Grasshopper?
* Point, Line, Curve
* Parameters and Variables
* Linked relationships
